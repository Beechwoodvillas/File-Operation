# File-Operation
In this project I will read characters from source.txt by using getline() function. The program will count the number and length of the sentences then store them in an array called: sentenceLength. The program will concatenate all the charachters to a string variable called concatenatedTarget. In this way the program can convert each letter to C-string style char array, so the characters will exist as a character sequence. The third function in the code will write the character sequence to target.txt and will cut the sequence in the correct position by using the information from sentenceLength array in order to provide the original shape and length of sentences.
